            <p>Gardening is in my blood. Initially inspired my grandfather. Whenever I’d visit, he’d spend all his time outside working in his garden at his miners terraced house in the Rhondda valley in South Wales. I was his shadow, always helping and getting “stuck-in”, particularly fascinated by his greenhouse packed with exotic cacti! Then of course there’s my dad, Terry Walton, BBC Radio2’s adopted “allotmenteer”. Many happy childhood hours were spent helping at his allotment plots or helping grow and tending the thousands of bedding plants that were planted out in the garden at home (it wasn’t until years later that I realised that not all kids did this!). My dad’s passion for everything garden related is infectious, and infected I became at a very early age. However, for some reason, I didn’t follow this up in my career choices. I guess, at the time I was in school, a career in horticulture wasn’t really a thing! My other artistic and creative passions alongside and all things technical, anengineering based Product Design degree soon followed. This was followed by time spent in industry as an engineer which then translated into another career in teaching design and engineering, both in schools and at higher levels. However, through all this time, my evenings and weekends were spent doing what I do best and love – gardening! I have always taken a massive amount of pleasure in creating beautiful outdoor spaces that can be enjoyed by my family, alongside growing fruit and vegetables to feed us all (we’re virtually self sufficient all year round with home grown vegetables).</p>
            <p>Being a lover of all things that grow and live in our gardens, I am also passionateabout nature,conservation, the protection of the environment and sustainability. I always gently try to encourage others to take these things into consideration when managing their gardens and believe I have a role to play in this in my position as a professional gardener. For instance, I love helping people to do things to encourage nature into their gardens. <br><br> Andy B Garden Services (the B is from my middle name – Brian!) evolved out of a realisation that I could channel all my skills, knowledge and experience, alongside my passion for all of our flora and fauna, to help others with everything gardening related. I now have the best job in the world.I love seeing “outdoor spaces becoming blissful places”!</p>
